This is my first real project created using html, css, and javascript all in conjunction.

This program was originally created with only Javascript and consisted of a console-only game where inputs were given to the console and outputs were also shown directly on the console.

The project now also consists of a user interface that includes buttons for the player to interact with as well as messages that would be displayed and uupdated depending on the buttons that were clicked.
